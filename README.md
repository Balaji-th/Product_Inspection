# Product_Inspection

Our project goal is to identify defective products and separate them at the production cycle itself.With the modern trend of Artificial Intelligence, we are going to implement deep learning-based computer vision technology to automate material quality inspection. 
The products are categorized into flawless materials, Minor defects-Surface imperfections, Major Defects-Out of tolerance on Non-critical dimensions.

The image of the material is captured in real-time while moving on the conveyor belt. Then comparing the data obtained from the captured image with the model which has been trained using the CNN algorithm, the material is classified as defective/flawless and then separated accordingly.
Using IoT, the data is sent and stored in a cloud server (AWS). From the stored data, the count of defective and non-defective materials is hosted and displayed in a secured webpage.
